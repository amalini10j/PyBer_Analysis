# PyBer_Analysis
Repository for ride sharing analysis

## Overview of ride sharing Analysis

Creating visualizations of ride share data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

The metrics that will aid in the data analysis of the ride sharing data are as follows:
- Total Rides for each city type
- Total Drivers for each city type
- Total Fares for each city type
- Average Fare per Ride for each city type
- Average Fare per Driver for each city type

## Resources
**Data Source:** city_data.csv , ride_data.csv
**Software:** Python 3.8, Visual Studio Code 1.59

## Ride-sharing Data Analysis Results

**How does the ride sharing data look like for different city types - urban, suburban and rural?**

The ride sharing metrics for different city types is as follows:
![RideSharing](/Images/RideShare_DataFrame.png)

The Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver is highest in rural areas. Additional effort is required to increase the affordability and accessibility of ride share in rural areas.

**What is the weekly outlook of total fares for each city type ?**
The weekly total fares is as shown in the graph below:
![WeeklyTotals](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

The weekly totals is highest for urban cities and lowest for rural areas.

## Ride sharing Data Analysis Summary
The recommendations based on the ride sharing data analysis are as follows:

1. The rural cities need more driver support as the average fare per driver is highest
2. The rural cities need more cars too as the average fare per ride is the highest
3. There is also high disparity in the average fare per driver and average fare per ride between urban and suburban cities. It would be good to try and increase the drivers and cars in suburban cities too in reduce the disparity in cost and availability.
